# MinecraftModProfiles
## What is it?
MinecraftModProfiles helps you to get an easy way of managing your Minecraft Mods in Profiles which you can simply select.
## How does it work?
It creates a settings file within the Location of the Program, that has all your profiles in it. In your .minecraft directory, you will get folders that match your Profile Name. If you select a Profile, all files in such a folder get copied into the mods folder.
